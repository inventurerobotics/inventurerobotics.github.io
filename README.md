# Inventure Robotics Website

## URL
This source code is intended for the main website for Inventure Robotics at:
https://www.inventurerobotics.org

## Deployment
This website is hosted on Github directly from the source code repository.  Whenever changes are pushed to the 
"main" branch, deployment happens automatically behind the scenes by Github.

This mechanism is configured via the repository settings, under Settings->Pages.

Starting here for detailed instructions:
https://pages.github.com/

For the security of our users, any traffic to HTTP will be automatically redirected to HTTPS.

## Develop
This is a static website so only HTML, Javascript, and CSS is used.  Besides linking to or embedding services from 
other websites, this website does not require any custom 
backend service.

Choose your favorite HTML editor, either in coding style (i.e., VS Code) or in visual editing style (i.e., Adobe 
Dreamweaver) to edit the source.  When you are done, simply commit and push to the main branch.  It'll take a minute 
for the changes to get deployed and to be seen on the production website.
